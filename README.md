## Installation

* Step 1: `rustup component add rust-src`.

* Step 2: Install `binaryen` in a version >= 99:

  * [Debian/Ubuntu](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/binaryen): `apt-get install binaryen`
  * [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/binaryen): `brew install binaryen`
  * [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/binaryen/): `pacman -S binaryen`
  * Windows: [binary releases are available](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/releases)

  There's only an old version in your distributions package manager? Just use a 
  [binary release](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/releases).

* Step 3: `cargo install --force cargo-eosiocontract`.


## Usage

You can always use `cargo eosiocontract help` to print information on available
commands and their usage.

For each command there is also a `--help` flag with info on additional parameters,
e.g. `cargo eosiocontract new --help`.

##### `cargo eosiocontract new my_contract`

Creates an initial smart contract with some scaffolding code into a new
folder `my_contract` .

The contract contains the source code for the [`Flipper`](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/blob/master/examples/flipper/lib.rs) 
contract, which is about the simplest "smart" contract you can build â€’ a `bool` which gets flipped
from `true` to `false` through the `flip()` function.

##### `cargo +nightly contract build`

Compiles the contract into optimized WebAssembly bytecode, generates metadata for it,
and bundles both together in a `<name>.contract` file, which you can use for
deploying the contract on-chain.

`cargo eosiocontract build` must be run using the `nightly` toolchain. If you have
[`rustup`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup) installed, the simplest way to
do so is `cargo +nightly contract build`.

To avoid having to always add `+nightly` you can also set `nightly` as the default
toolchain of a directory by executing `rustup override set nightly` in it.

##### `cargo eosiocontract check`

Checks that the code builds as WebAssembly. This command does not output any `<name>.contract`
artifact to the `target/` directory.
